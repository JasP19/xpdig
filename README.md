![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

`crossplane trace` is a very handy tool, but it is not very interactive and requires a few extra
hops to properly debug its traced objects. This tool aims on closing this gap by providing
an interactive tracing explorer based on the tool tracer output.

## ‚ú® Features

- Allow copying/yanking object value, including API group to avoid conflict
- Display last transition times by default

### Upcoming

- Describe Kubernetes object from the explorer
- Allow expanding error messages in the UI (shortcut `K`)
- Allow mutating resource annotations (pause, finaliser)

## üìÄ Install

### Linux and Windows

[Check the releases section](https://github.com/brunoluiz/crossplane-explorer/releases) for more information details.

```

### Other

Use `go install` to install it

```
